# Rabin-Miller-primality-test
This main goal of this project is to implement and examine the Rabin-Miller primality test 
through the Python programming language. The Rabin-Miller primality test is designed to 
define whether the number is not prime, in other words that means, whether the number is 
composite. That is due to the nature of this test, which doesnâ€™t provide a direct answer, but 
tells that the number is probably prime or not.
